![banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bucketon/OWRandomSpeedrun/main/ngplogo.png)
Random shipless speedrun generator for Outer Wilds

# How to play
1. When the mod is active, there is a new item on the main menu called Nomai Grand Prix.
2. When you select Nomai Grand Prix you will see two lists of points of interest in the game.
3. The lists will have random points of interest selected when you first open it. You can choose points manually, or you can press the randomize button to choose a new random pair of points.
4. Once you have a start and end point you're happy with, press confirm to start the game. You will spawn at the start point you selected.
5. Navigate to the end point with no spaceship to win! The mod will track your time and display it once you've won so you can share a screenshot of your achievement.

_Tip: the best way to play is to race with your friends. Have everyone pick the same start and end points and start the game at the same time!_
